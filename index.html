        <h2>My Biography</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Philippines – Metro Manila at the Chinese General Hospital on September 7, 2004 with a strict, but caring supportive family. My parents are both caring and strict as they normally balance out when I would play games and study for my education. As a child, I was very energetic as I would often go outside and play with my friends. At school I was not the brightest bunch of the students, I would often have a hard time memorizing because memorizing speeches was my weakness back then, but in the end I would improvise and come out successful with my performance because I put in work. Back then I would spent countless hours hopping on my computer and sometimes play some basketball outside because they were the things that I would love to do even to this day. Every time I would go to my grandparent’s was my favorite time back then because I really loved seeing my grandparents, my aunts and uncles, and even my cousins. During school, I had a group of friends with similar interests since also my school back then when I was an elementary, it did not had any sections because it was just a small private school. Our family didn’t had any serious traditions back then, we only do what other normal family does like go to church on Sunday, celebrate Christmas, and New Year like normal. I also have a strong bond with my family as we have shared countless struggles, and some good memories. Well the first challenges as a kid that I had back then was I was very timid, I didn’t like doing open speeches because I had a low self-esteem and was very scared at what people might think of me when I messed something up, but of course as I grew up I gained more self-esteem and started to overcome my fear. Looking back, my childhood was full of love, playing games, a little bit of mischief, and a sense of curiousness. I had one particular role model back then and still is today, it is actually the famous basketball player Lebron James, now you might be wondering why I chose him as my role model? It is because he actually started from nothing and grinded life to become who he is now. Basketball is one of my favorite activities and I admired on how the famous basketball player Lebron James played, I even sometimes mimic his playstyle with sudden pull-up threes and midrange shots. My grandfather also taught me some good life lessons like embracing failure, forgiveness, and don’t give in to hatred. It was very important for me to learn those life lessons because I would always carry them with my shoulder as I grow up in life. It would guide me in what I should do in life and I would always remember what my grandfather have said to me. I didn’t actually plan to become an IT student in college because being an Engineer was my dream back then, but as I grew older, I realized my talent was in the studies of my computer because in my childhood I had spent countless hours growing my knowledge on it and later realized, I had a talent for it. Times are now changing and I am now a college student. The simple joys of childhood with no realization of reality was simply a memory now, how I will truly miss it.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My teenage years was a blast for me, a time for discovering myself, my growth spurt, and learning from my mistakes. The transition to middle school to high school has very new for as I met new friends along my journey at high school. My favorite subjects back then in high school was Robotics and Physical Education. My high school back then also had clubs to join and I decided to join a cooking club, and basketball club. On grade seven I joined the cooking club and after that in grade 8, I decided to change clubs and joined the basketball club until I graduated from high school. I had fascination about robotics back then because we would see how small robots would move depending on how we program them, this might be the first sign on why would I choose BSIT as my college course. As my high school journey went on new friends start to gather with me. During those years I had my friends with me by my side with a strong bond as we still keep talking to each other even we are now separated at college. We would often start planning some friend gatherings like going to the mall, a trip to the beach, and Discord game nights always. We would always communicate at Discord every day and night to play games and watch some movies if we wanted to. I am very glad that I have met them in my life because I have someone to laugh and smile with. I have experienced my first big responsibility as I’ve been nominated as a leader in my group at the cooking club back then. It would teach me some financial management and responsibility as it was a big step for me in my high school life. There was also a time where I have forgot to bring a specific ingredient because it was our group’s time to cook, in the end we had to borrow some ingredients to the other group to make up for some losses and as a group leader I was ashamed for myself. Even though a mistake happened during my time as group leader, I did learn from it and continued to be better as I have become more responsible and made it up for my group members because from that day that I forgot an ingredient, I have made sure to myself that I never forgot a single ingredient every time that it was our group’s turn to cook. As a student back then I also learned time management because of my nature to play computer games, I had to balance both of them because games will not ever disappear in my life and education is a one-time opportunity that has been given to me and I would make sure not to waste that opportunity. Balancing both games and studies was hard at first but as I grew, it was now a piece of cake as I have a sense of responsibility. During my time as senior high school, it is time that I should plan on what I should take on college. I have finally decided to take BSIT on University of the East. It was truly a pivotal moment for me to take BSIT, which set foundation for my college journey, it was nerve-wracking at first because this was uncharted territory as I prepared for a new chapter in my life.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day of college finally comes and at first I was actually intimidated, new faces emerge, professors who take their job seriously, and the college level modules that needs to be done before due dates. It was an entirely new world for me but at the same time, full of opportunities and challenges that I may face for the real word. Stepping onto the campus of University of the East was a game changer as it was a very big campus, at first I was not used to it because it was not as vast as my previous schools, but after some time, I finally settled in. I chose BSIT as my major because of my knowledge and talent at handling computers. The independence of college life has required me to master on how to handle myself in various ways like balancing my time schedule, academics, and social life. At first day of school I quickly met a group of friends who I share some different interests with and overtime we helped each other grew. One of my most notable memories at college was at the Christmas lighting event as it was very good time to start the joyful season of December. There were some professors who made an impact at my course who changed my way of viewing computer studies. There were even nights where I had to stay up to study for my finals so I could be confident that I would pass it and I would confidently say that I have passed all my finals exam during my 1st year studying at UE. We now arrived at the present time where I am a 2nd year student studying BSIT at University of the East. I have learned a few programming languages such as Python, Java, C#, MySQL, etc. My knowledge of computer studies have slightly deepened as I have learned the concepts and history of computers. College was not about just academics but a personal growth and discovering my passions on my studies. Of course college is not easy and get-going like high school and middle school, in college you have to get serious because you will face the harsh real world after college. I intend to push my limits during my time in college and face whatever challenges that may come ahead. It will be a hard path ahead yes but most importantly, it will lead your destination for enlightenment. I have learned from my failures countless times as my professors have gave me some advices with my works and how I should improve it. Each mistake is a stepping stone for me as I refine my skills in programming and understanding computers. I have realized that success is not something you get through quick catch-ups on lessons but from understanding your mistakes like my grandfather just taught me. With every new lesson, and every challenge, I will shape myself and continue to be the person I envisioned to take on the future.
